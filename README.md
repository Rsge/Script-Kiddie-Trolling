# Script-Kiddie-Trolling
Just a few fun scripts a friend and I used as tweens in our computer sciences course to troll others, revised using my current knowledge.

* `Annoy.bat` just annoys the user by constantly starting and clsoing itself.
* `HardKill.bat` opens itself in a loop, each instance again opening new instances.
* `Matrix.bat` starts a number matrix with green random numbers on a black background.
* `Open.bat` opens a YT video.
* `ShutdownDefense.bat` constantly tries to abort a scheduled shutdown.
* `SoftKill.bat` opens itself and stays open afterwards.
* `SuperAttack.bat` starts a shutdown on a specified remote PC.
