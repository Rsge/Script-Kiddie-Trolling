# Script-Kiddie-Trolling
Just a few fun scripts a friend and I used as teens in our computer sciences course to troll others, revised using my current knowledge.

* `Annoy.cmd` starts a new instance of itself, then closes the current one.
* `HardKill.cmd` opens new instances of itself in a loop, each instance again opening new instances in a loop.
* `Matrix.cmd` starts a number matrix with rapidly changing random green symbols on a black background.
* `Open.cmd` opens a YouTube video.
* `ShutdownDefense.cmd` constantly tries to abort a scheduled shutdown.
* `SoftKill.cmd` opens new instances of itself and stays open afterwards.
* `SuperAttack.cmd` starts a shutdown on specified remote PCs.
